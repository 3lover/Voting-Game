# Find out who most likely isn't actually your friend in this hilarious spin-off of the Voting Game!

In the voting game, individual players play in groups, with a single card being drawn every round.
After a card is drawn, players vote for who they think the card best fits
*That's not the end however...*
After voting for the player you think fits the card, all players recieve the number of people who voted them.
Afterwards, it becomes a game of betrayal and guessing who voted them before the votes are eventually revealed for all to see
